#### Data Source Integration and Preprocessing Steps

1. **Adding a New Data Source:**

   To integrate a new data source, update the `config.yaml` file with the relevant details of the new data source. Each entry should include the name of the data source, the URL, the index of the table on the webpage, and the desired output file name.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   data_sources:
     - name: Example Data Source
       url: 'https://example.com/data'
       table_index: 0
       output_file: 'example_data.csv'
   
2. **Fetching and Parsing Data:**

The script fetches the content of the URL specified in the configuration file and parses the specified table using BeautifulSoup. The fetch_page function ensures that any errors in fetching the page are logged, and the parse_table function handles potential issues in parsing the table.

3. **Extracting and Preprocessing Data:**

Data is extracted from the parsed HTML table and stored in a Pandas DataFrame. The extract_data_from_table function handles this process and ensures that any issues are logged. Additional preprocessing steps can be added within this function as needed.

4. **Saving Data:**

The extracted and preprocessed data is saved to a CSV file using the save_to_csv function. This function ensures that the data is saved correctly and logs any issues encountered during the process.

**Example Workflow**
Add a new data source to config.yaml.
Run the data_scraper.py script.
The script logs the progress and any issues encountered.
The extracted data is saved to the specified CSV file.
Error Handling and Logging
The script includes comprehensive error handling and logging to ensure robustness. Errors in fetching pages, parsing tables, extracting data, and saving data are all logged with appropriate error messages. This logging helps in diagnosing issues and ensuring that the data collection process is reliable.

**Configuration Flexibility**
Using a YAML configuration file makes it easy to add new data sources or modify existing ones without changing the code. This flexibility is crucial for maintaining and scaling the data collection process as new data sources are added.
